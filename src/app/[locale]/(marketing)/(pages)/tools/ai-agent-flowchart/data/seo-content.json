      "content": "An AI agent flowchart is a visual representation of the logic, decision-making processes, and interactions of an autonomous AI agent. It maps out how the agent perceives its environment, processes information, makes decisions, and executes actions. This tool helps developers and system architects design, visualize, and debug complex agent behaviors, ensuring that the AI operates as intended within its defined constraints."
